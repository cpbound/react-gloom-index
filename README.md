# Daily Gloom Index #

# What on earth is this?
How awful are you feeling on a scale of 1 to 10 today? Well, tell this application and it'll list all of the Radiohead songs that a roughly as bleak as you're currently feeling.

# But why?
Because Radiohead are a good bunch of lads and listening to sad songs when your sad is the best medicine for the blues. IN ADDITION, this was a quick little playground for me to experiment with React and MaterialUI.

# Will it do anything else?
I dunno. Maybe? Maybe I'll add features to narrow down searches or export to Spotify or something like that. Who knows? Certainly not me since I'm still learning what React and MUI can do so we'll see what happens.
