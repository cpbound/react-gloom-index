# Daily Gloom Index #

# What on earth is this?
How awful are you feeling on a scale of 1 to 10 today? Well, tell this application and it'll list all of the Radiohead songs that are roughly as bleak as you're currently feeling.

# But why?
Because Radiohead are a good bunch of lads and listening to sad songs when you're sad is the best medicine for the blues. IN ADDITION, this was a quick little playground for me to experiment with ES6, React and MaterialUI.

# Will it do anything else?
I dunno. Maybe? Time permitting I might come back to this and implement all of this jazz...
1. Responsive UI - It probably needs this more than anything to be fair since it sucks on mobile. DON'T LOOK AT IT ON MOBILE YET.
2. Test suite - This would be more than lovely!
2. Playlist functionality - Like search or shuffle or narrow down or some bollocks like that
3. Spotify integration - Because playing with APIs is fun
4. Extended Radiohead Backcatalogue - currently the Gloom Index data set only covers Radiohead albums. Imagine the possibilities if you included B-Sides or single only releases like that awful remix of Creep! But not Pop is Dead. Never pop is dead
